## Project Overview
Many households struggle with proper waste disposal due to difficulties in identifying and categorizing different types of waste.
This leads to improper waste management, contributing to environmental pollution and inefficiencies in recycling processes.
Our team aims to address this issue by developing a mobile application that helps users, especially homemakers,
identify and sort their household waste correctly.

## Project Scope
**Mobile App Development :**
- Waste Scan, Waste Blog Education, Waste Predict History
- User Account Management, Daily Quest

**Cloud Computing Infrastructure**
- Scalable and reliable environment
- Server-side components for user management, data storage
- Serving machine learning model

**Machine Learning Integration**
- Tensorflow Machine Learning Model
- Integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow model into the application to perform predictions or classifications.
- Ensure the TensorFlow model is optimized for small size and fast inference.
- Implement model version control and easy updates for future improvements.


**Tools/IDE/Library:**
- **Figma**: UI/UX design collaboration
- **Flutter**: UI sodtware development kit from Google
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud storage, Cloud SQL, compute engine, cloud run
- **Tensforflow**: Build Machine learning
- **ExpressJS**: Build REST API
- **Flask PY**: serve model and API for predict
